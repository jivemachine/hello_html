<h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>"When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, 
        my mother would say to me, â€œLook for the helpers. You will always 
        find people who are helping." - Fred Rodgers</p>
    <div><p>I think the div labels make a greater amount of space between text like, 
        starting a new paragraph.
        and the p tags are just for adding text?
