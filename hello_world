      <h3>Here is a quote</h3>
      <p>"When I was a boy and I would see <strong>scary</strong> things in the news, 
        my mother would say to me, â€œLook for the <em>helpers</em>. You will always 
        find people who are helping." - Fred Rodgers</p>

      <p>I think the div labels make a greater amount of space between text like, 
        starting a new paragraph.
        and the p tags are just for adding text?
